      "You can't have passed each other. I know what: \n",
      "He must have changed his mind and gone to Garlands. \n",
      "He won't be long in that case. You can wait. \n",

      "It's gone so far. You've heard? Estelle's run off.' \n",
      "'Yes, what's it all about? When did she go?' \n",
      "'Two weeks since.' \n",
      "'She's in earnest, it appears.' \n",
      "'I'm sure she won't come back. She's hiding somewhere. \n",
      "I don't know where myself. John thinks I do. \n",
      "He thinks I only have to say the word, \n",
      "And she'll come back. But, bless you, I'm her mother- \n",
      "I can't talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!' \n",

      "With me to sit and tell him everything, \n",

      "He and I only hinder one another. \n",
      "I tell them they can't get me through the door, though: \n",

      "We've been here fifteen years.' \n",
      "'That's a long time \n",

      "How do you see him living when you're gone? \n",
      "Two of you out will leave an empty house.' \n",

      "Left here with nothing but the furniture. \n",
      "I hate to think of the old place when we're gone, \n",
      "With the brook going by below the yard, \n",
      "And no one here but hens blowing about. \n",
      "If he could sell the place, but then, he can't: \n",
      "No one will ever live on it again. \n",
      "It's too run down. This is the last of it. \n",
      "What I think he will do, is let things smash. \n",

      "I never saw a man let family troubles \n",
      "Make so much difference in his man's affairs. \n",
      "He's just dropped everything. He's like a child. \n",
      "I blame his being brought up by his mother. \n",
      "He's got hay down that's been rained on three times. \n",
      "He hoed a little yesterday for me: \n",
      "I thought the growing things would do him good. \n",
      "Something went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe \n",
      "Sky-high with both hands. I can see it now- \n",
      "Come here- I'll show you- in that apple tree. \n",
      "That's no way for a man to do at his age: \n",

      "'Which is wrong!' \n",
      "'Yes, but he should have married her.' \n",
      "'I know.' \n",
      "'The strain's been too much for her all these years: \n",
      "I can't explain it any other way. \n",
      "It's different with a man, at least with John: \n",
      "He knows he's kinder than the run of men. \n",
      "Better than married ought to be as good \n",
      "As married- that's what he has always said. \n",
      "I know the way he's felt- but all the same!' \n",
      "'I wonder why he doesn't marry her \n",
      "And end it.' \n",
      "'Too late now: she wouldn't have him. \n",
      "He's given her time to think of something else. \n",
      "That's his mistake. The dear knows my interest \n",
      "Has been to keep the thing from breaking up. \n",
      "This is a good home: I don't ask for better. \n",
      "But when I've said, 'Why shouldn't they be married,' \n",
      "He'd say, 'Why should they?' no more words than that.' \n",
      "'And after all why should they? John's been fair \n",
      "I take it. What was his was always hers. \n",
      "There was no quarrel about property.' \n",
      "'Reason enough, there was no property. \n",
      "A friend or two as good as own the farm, \n",
      "Such as it is. It isn't worth the mortgage.' \n",
      "'I mean Estelle has always held the purse.' \n",
      "'The rights of that are harder to get at. \n",
      "I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse. \n",
      "'Twas we let him have money, not he us. \n",
      "John's a bad farmer. I'm not blaming him. \n",
      "Take it year in, year out, he doesn't make much. \n",
      "We came here for a home for me, you know, \n",
      "Estelle to do the housework for the board \n",
      "Of both of us. But look how it turns out: \n",
      "She seems to have the housework, and besides, \n",
      "Half of the outdoor work, though as for that, \n",
      "He'd say she does it more because she likes it. \n",
      "You see our pretty things are all outdoors. \n",
      "Our hens and cows and pigs are always better \n",
      "Than folks like us have any business with. \n",
      "Farmers around twice as well off as we \n",
      "Haven't as good. They don't go with the farm. \n",
      "One thing you can't help liking about John, \n",
      "He's fond of nice things- too fond, some would say. \n",
      "But Estelle don't complain: she's like him there. \n",
      "She wants our hens to be the best there are. \n",
      "You never saw this room before a show, \n",
      "Full of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds \n",
      "In separate coops, having their plumage done. \n",
      "The smell of the wet feathers in the heat! \n",
      "You spoke of John's not being safe to stay with. \n",
      "You don't know what a gentle lot we are: \n",
      "We wouldn't hurt a hen! You ought to see us \n",
      "Moving a flock of hens from place to place. \n",
      "We're not allowed to take them upside down, \n",
      "All we can hold together by the legs. \n",
      "Two at a time's the rule, one on each arm, \n",
      "No matter how far and how many times \n",
      "We have to go.' \n",
      "'You mean that's John's idea.' \n",
      "'And we live up to it; or I don't know \n",
      "What childishness he wouldn't give way to. \n",
      "He manages to keep the upper hand \n",
      "On his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens: \n",
      "We fence our flowers in and the hens range. \n",
      "Nothing's too good for them. We say it pays. \n",
      "John likes to tell the offers he has had, \n",
      "Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that. \n",
      "He never takes the money. If they're worth \n",
      "That much to sell, they're worth as much to keep. \n",
      "Bless you, it's all expense, though. Reach me down \n",
      "The little tin box on the cupboard shelf, \n",
      "The upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one. \n",
      "I'll show you. Here you are.' \n",
      "'What's this?' \n",
      "'A bill- \n",
      "For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock- \n",
      "Receipted. And the cock is in the yard.' \n",
      "'Not in a glass case, then?' \n",
      "'He'd need a tall one: \n",
      "He can eat off a barrel from the ground. \n",
      "He's been in a glass case, as you may say, \n",
      "The Crystal Palace, London. He's imported. \n",
      "John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads- \n",
      "Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain. \n",
      "But you see, don't you, we take care of him.' \n",
      "'And like it, too. It makes it all the worse.' \n",
      "'It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless \n",
      "In ways that I can hardly tell you of. \n",
      "Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts \n",
      "To see where all the money goes so fast. \n",
      "You know how men will be ridiculous. \n",
      "But it's just fun the way he gets bedeviled- \n",
      "If he's untidy now, what will he be- - ? \n",
      "'It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.' \n",
      "'Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me.' \n",
      "'Can't you and I get to the root of it? \n",
      "What's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?' \n",
      "'It's as I say: she's turned from him, that's all.' \n",
      "'But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours, \n",
      "Being cut off from friends?' \n",
      "'We have our friends. \n",
      "That isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us.' \n",
      "'She's let it worry her. You stood the strain, \n",
      "And you're her mother.' \n",
      "'But I didn't always. \n",
      "I didn't relish it along at first. \n",
      "But I got wonted to it. And besides- \n",
      "John said I was too old to have grandchildren. \n",
      "But what's the use of talking when it's done? \n",
      "She won't come back- it's worse than that- she can't.' \n",
      "'Why do you speak like that? What do you know? \n",
      "What do you mean?- she's done harm to herself?' \n",
      "'I mean she's married- married someone else.' \n",
      "'Oho, oho!' \n",
      "'You don't believe me.' \n",
      "'Yes, I do, \n",
      "Only too well. I knew there must be something! \n",
      "So that was what was back. She's bad, that's all!' \n",
      "'Bad to get married when she had the chance?' \n",
      "'Nonsense! See what's she done! But who, who- - ' \n",
      "'Who'd marry her straight out of such a mess? \n",
      "Say it right out- no matter for her mother. \n",
      "The man was found. I'd better name no names. \n",
      "John himself won't imagine who he is.' \n",
      "'Then it's all up. I think I'll get away. \n",
      "You'll be expecting John. I pity Estelle; \n",
      "I suppose she deserves some pity, too. \n",

      "And this bill.' \n",

       "'Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\\n\\nThe dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.\\n\\nAnd Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government\\'s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n\\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.'"

       "'Ad sales boost Time Warner profit\\n\\nQuarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.\\n\\nThe firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.\\n\\nTime Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL\\'s underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL\\'s existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.\\n\\nTime Warner\\'s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts\\' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\\n\\nTimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann\\'s purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.'"
